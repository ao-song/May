libBERT
-------

libBERT is a C library for encoding and decoding BERT (Binary ERlang Term)
data [1]. Inspired by the Ruby BERT library [2], libBERT aims to provide the
full BERT format to C programmers.

Benefits of BERT
----------------

* Compact binary representation.
* Defined by a specification [1].

Benefits of libBERT
-------------------

* Written as a C library.
* Portable.
* Robust.
* Small.
* Fast (did I mention it was written in C, the language of fast?).
* Supports encoding/decoding of:
  * Integers.
  * Floating point numbers.
  * Atoms.
  * Strings.
  * Binary data.
  * Tuples.
  * Lists.
  * Complex types:
    * Nil.
    * Boolean True and False values.
    * Dictionaries.
    * Time values.
    * Regular Expressions.
* Supports buffered, streaming or callback-based reading/writing of
  BERT data.
* Distributed under the MIT "as-is" license.

Examples
--------

Decode a given buffer:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <bert.h>

    int main(int argc,const char *argv[])
    {
        char *buffer;
        size_t buffer_length;

        // allocate and fill the buffer

        bert_decoder_t *decoder = bert_decoder_create();
        bert_decoder_buffer(decoder, buffer, buffer_length);

        bert_data_t *data;
        int result;

        // decode BERT data
        if ((result = bert_decoder_pull(decoder, &data)) != 1)
        {
            fprintf(stderr,"bert error: %s\n", bert_strerror(result));

            bert_decoder_destroy(decoder);
            return -1;
	}

        if (data->type != bert_data_tuple)
        {
            fprintf(stderr,"BERT data was not a tuple\n");

	    bert_data_destroy(data);
	    bert_decoder_destroy(decoder);
	    return -1;
        }

        printf("BERT tuple decoded with %d elements\n",data->tuple->length);

        bert_data_destroy(data);
        bert_decoder_destroy(decoder);
        return 0;
    }


Build Dependencies
------------

* CMake >= 2.6.0 [2]

Installing libBERT
----------------

  $ cmake .

  * Or run "ccmake ." for a ncurses based configuration menu.

  $ make
  $ sudo make install
